1. Summary Statistics:
The summary_stats function calculates basic statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) for each car category (Sedan, SUV, Truck). The statistics are printed for each category, providing insights into the central tendency and variability of the car prices in each category.

2. Highest and Lowest Prices:
For each category, the code identifies and prints the highest and lowest priced models, as well as the corresponding car model names. This helps identify which models are priced the highest and the lowest within each category.

3. Average Price Bar Plot:
A bar plot is created showing the average price of cars in each category (Sedan, SUV, Truck). This plot visually compares the average prices across the three categories, providing a clear view of which category has the highest average price.

4. Histograms for Each Category:
For each category (Sedan, SUV, and Truck), a histogram is created to show the distribution of car prices. Each histogram represents the frequency of car prices within certain price ranges, giving insights into how car prices are spread out within each category.

5. Box Plot:
A box plot is created to show the spread of car prices across the three categories. It visually represents the distribution of prices, including the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. This helps to compare the range of car prices in each category.

Summary of Key Insights:
